# Groups Tabs shortcuts - chrome extension

This extension aims at binding some simple yet powerful chrome tabs commands to shortcuts.

By default no shortcut is provided in order to avoid collision with other plugins, you can set your own in the page: [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).

Current supported commands:

1. `new-tab-in-group`: creates a new tab in the current group (group of the current tab)
1. `collapse-all-groups`: collapses all the groups
1. `expand-all-groups`: expands all the groups
